# Medical - Assignments

For each task the  **codes, data and documentation** are in the corresponding folders.  


## 1.	Task 1
To train a classifier on the dataset to predict the probability of **diabetes**. 

Based on the performance it can be concluded that the model performs a good job at classifying the diabetes as Patients (1) or Healthy (0)


## 2.	Task 2
To find relationship between mortality rate **(cancer, Alzheimer's disease and obesity)**. 
*	**Cancer:** There are 300 observations (50 States and 6 years from 2014 to 2019)
*	**Alzheimer's disease:** There are 300 observations (50 States and 6 years from 2014 to 2019)
*	**Obesity:** There are 50 observations (50 States and 1 year that is 2019)


## 3.	Task 3
To train a classifier on the dataset to predict the probability of **Parkinson disease**. 

Based on the performance it can be concluded that the model performs a good job at classifying the Parkinson disease as Patients (1) or Healthy (0)


## 4.	Task 4
To train a classifier on the dataset to predict the probability of **breast cancer**. 

Based on the performance it can be concluded that the model performs a good job at classifying the breast cancer as Patients (1) or Healthy controls (0)


## 5.	Task 5
The current analysis is done to understand the survival in patients with **advanced lung cancer** from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.
*	Determine the survival curve through the Kaplan Meyer Estimator
*	Understand differences between Males and Females
*	Driver Analysis with Cox Proportional Hazard
